My project is in /project/toy.
To compile it just type "make load" in /project/toy directory.

How it works?

Button S1 - Turns On/Off the buzzer.
Button S2 - Turns On/Off the Green Light (P1.0)
Button S3 - Turns On/Off the Red Light (P1.6)
Button S4 - Turns On both lights and made them flash rapidly simultaneously.
            If the buzzer is turned on when both lights are flashing rapidly, the lights will start flashing slower, to the rhythm of the buzzer. (Still simultaneously)
            In addition, if both lights are flashing to the buzzer's rhythm, and the user presses either button S2 or S3, the lights will stop flashing simultaneously, and instead the lights will alternate to the buzzer''s rhythm. In order to make the lights to flash again simultaneously, just press again either the S2 or S3 button.
            Furthermore, in order to make the lights to flash faster (not to the buzzer's rhythm), just turn off the buzzer.
            Finally, in order to make both lights to stop flashing, just press again the S4 button.
